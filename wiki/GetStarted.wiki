#summary Get Started by Installing the Mobile Cloud Platform and Examples


===Install Cloud Server===

  * *Step 1:* Download and install JBoss-5.1.0.GA from [http://www.jboss.org/jbossas/downloads/ here]

  * *Step 2:* Copy *openmobster* to the JBoss AS _server_ directory. *openmobster* is a pre-configured/optimized instance for the OpenMobster Cloud Server

  * *Step 3:* In the case of using MySQL5 as the database, modify *openmobster-ds.xml* according to your own MySQL5 instance

  * *Step 4:* Start the JBoss AS instance with the OpenMobster binary installed using: 
    {{{run -c openmobster -b "a real IP address"}}}

    _*Note:*_ A real IP address like "192.168.0.1" or something like that is needed for the mobile device to be able to connect to the server. Even in the case of a simulation environment, the device's browser does not connect to a loopback address like "localhost" or "127.0.0.1"
